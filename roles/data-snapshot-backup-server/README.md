This role acts as a web-accessible backup of the base Data Snapshot.

It works by hosting as an up-to-date mirror of the origin repository.

Should the origin fail, restoration can occur from this location.

TODO: Assess the complications that could occur should the origin fail before this has had a chance to update, but after something else has updated.
